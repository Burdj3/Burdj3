- 👋 Hi, I’m @Burdj3 . Most people just call me Jack.
- 👀 I’m interested in getting better at coding. I'd like to write cleaner code more efficiently, and learn how to make some cool applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Science @ University of Houston - Clear Lake.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really. I want to learn new things such as cloud storage and how to design better user interfaces. I'm also interested in learning more about Unreal Engine specifically since I'd enjoy making indie games in my free time.
- 📫 How to reach me: email me at burdj3@gmail.com
